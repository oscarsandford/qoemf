# Project Proposal

We propose designing and demonstrating a framework for measuring QoE (quality of experience) for clients connecting to a server over a virtual 
network using [mininet](http://mininet.org/). Alterations on the server-side (e.g. flow control policy, packet drop rates) will be used to simulate 
load or unstable connection. On the client-side, we can recreate DoS and other attacks on the server in a controlled and natural way in order to 
see how the server responds. Our primary objective will be to understand how these various factors influence the quality of experience for clients 
connecting to the network.
