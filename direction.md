Overview of the problem. Why is it important?


What has already been done? Why are their efforts not sufficient?


What is our approach? Why can it do better or differently?


Some plots and stuff here about what we did.

Outline:
INTRO/PROBLEM STATEMENT:
    intro to QoS and why it is important
    differences from QoE
    => various domains have diff standards when it comes to the idea of QoS, 
        hard to understand what it means to have a "good quality of service"
        without giving weights to the different parameters that can be measured

PROBLEM WITH PREVIOUS WORK:
    surveys into QoS in specific domains show what works best in their domains, and shadows other parameters
    with network emulation, QoS is investigated on a more general view 

OUR APPROACH:
    we want to provide such a general overview on a general view on QoS metrics and how they are 
    used to validate the service integrity of applications in various domains from online gaming to video streaming to file transfer 
    in client-server and P2P scenerios

BACKGROUND:
- network emulation
    - background

throughput, jitter, delay, packet loss, security{}

DOMAINS:
- online multiplayer games
    - RTS, FPS, MOBA, MMORPG, turn-based
- p2p file transfer
    - Napster, Gnutella, BitTorrent
- email, financial, medical (security?)
    - 
- remote login (security?)
    - ssh
- video streaming (VR)
    - live streaming, Netflix
- voice over IP (VoIP)
    - Discord, Skype
