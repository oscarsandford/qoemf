% Overview of the problem. Why is it important?
\section{Introduction}
The design of computer networks is driven by a drive towards a target quality of service (QoS), a set of performance measurements. Further, the implementation of 
network architectures demands time and money, and implementations that fail to meet quality of service standards waste time for both companies and customers. 
Software-defined networks (SDN) addresses the project of static architectures by enabling programming and measurement in a dynamic setting. It is important to understand 
and harness the strengths of SDN in a methodical way, so developers can focus more on the design goals and less on tedious implementation tasks.

\section{Approach}
Mininet will be utilized as a network emulator, for it has seen significant use in related works \cite{mininet_emulation_2014,qos_analysis_2022,chauhan_atulkar_2020} and 
is well-documented. The Iperf tool was used in \cite{chauhan_atulkar_2020} for generating network traffic, and we think that this tool will be appropriate for the same 
purposes in this study. We will reuse the quality of service metrics outlined in \cite{qos_analysis_2022}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Throughput (total transmitted data in bits)/(total time taken in seconds)
    \item Delay (time required to transmit the data from sender to receiver)
    \item Packet loss (the number of packets not delivered to their destination)
    \item Jitter (the variance in latency)
\end{itemize} 
Previous studies have defined quality of services measurements and used network emulation tools to program their own experiments. However, there does not seem to be a 
general method through which network emulation tools can be used, in association with quality of service measurement techniques, in order to test network architectures 
for their performance before they are implemented in real-world applications. \\\\
We will use Mininet's toolkit create a server around a given application (i.e. a simple Node.js application), and artificially adjust flow control, packet drop rate, 
and jitter from the server-side. Mininet will be able to measure packet return trip time (RTT), delay, and throughput from the server to clients, and the results of 
these measurements will determine how the overall quality of service changes as various server-side features are tweaked dynamically. Further, we will show how to use 
Mininet to simulate DoS attacks by a large number of clients in order to observe how attacks affect quality of service to benign users.
